Welcome to my simple ASCOM drivers. These <span class=GramE>drivers</span>
interface to my Arduino Nano Every-based monitor, which includes pressure,
humidity, rain, temperature, sky temperature and light level.

In the case of the safety monitor, it assesses humidity, rain and cloud
levels to determine the safe state. 

The observing conditions monitor just relays the values for the sensors,
computing dewpoint.

The sensors in the Arduino project are sampled at different rates, according
to need. Rain, every 2 seconds, everything else (apart from light level) every
15 seconds. Light level (which takes a long time to read) is every 2 minutes.
The light sensor is the same used in my long-time darkroom meters and more
recently in <span class=SpellE>UnihedronÂ’s</span> SQM range. It converts light
into a frequency. At magnitude 22, the frequency is 1/40seconds. It requires a
UV/IR filter to improve accuracy and shielding from extraneous light (like the
PCB LEDs etc.)

The module outputs a string :
$tempC, humidity, pressure, skyrawC, ambientC, skymag, rainratio #

These are 2 decimal point strings of floating point numbers. The rain value is
a ratio between current and dry sensor capacitance. The sensor itself is
intelligently heating, to avoid condensation. It self-calibrates to some extent
and can detect a single rain drop, which causes a 20% increase in value. The
rain sensor has a thermistor too, which is monitored to prevent over-heating.>

<p>The choosers in both drivers allow some flexibility in thresholds and
calibration of the system. Future enhancements may allow the values to be
stored within the device in non-volatile memory.
	The device itself uses the standard USB interface for serial
communications and power. There is also an additional 9V battery that is used
for self-power and also for the rain sensor heater. The LED display is
optional, and allows the unit to be standalone; a rolling display is triggered
by the pushbutton switch.

The MLX90614 IC is tricky to find in 5V form (AAA) but the
3.3V version (BAA) is more prevalent is often found as a small module on
Amazon, complete with a tiny 3.3V regulator and pull up resistors on SCL and
SDA lines. It is a fickle device and I use N-channel FETs to convert logic
levels with the 5V ones on the Arduino.
	
The cloud cover is based on the adjusted sky temperature.
The raw sky temperature reading is adjusted for ambient temperature and in general,
is almost clear at 0C, completely clear at -15C and overcast at +15C.
